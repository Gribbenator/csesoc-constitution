Register of Members
-------------------

    DISCUSS WITH ARC LEGAL, HOW DOES THIS WORK -- I don't think we should make this available.

#. The secretary must establish and maintain a register of members of CSESoc (whether in written or electronic form) specifying the name and postal, residential or email address of each person who is a member of CSESoc together with the date on which the person became a member.

   #. at the main premises of CSESoc, or

#. The register of members must be open for inspection, free of charge, by any member of CSESoc at any reasonable hour.
#. A member of CSESoc may obtain a copy of any part of the register on payment of a fee of not more than $1 for each page copied.
#. If a member requests that any information contained on the register about the member (other than the member’s name) not be available for inspection, that information must not be made available for inspection.
#. A member must not use information about a person obtained from the register to contact or send material to the person, other than for: 
   #. the purposes of sending the person a newsletter, a notice in respect of a meeting or other event relating to CSESoc or other material relating to CSESoc, or
   #. any other purpose necessary to comply with a requirement of the Act or the Regulation.
#. If the register of members is kept in electronic form:
